PTTGoodRead
===========

A userscript made for better browsing PTT web BBS. Even PTT web BBS now can
show images automatically, sometimes it won't show but only links. This
script aims to fix it, and add lightbox effect (currently under development.)

For Firefox users, please install Greasemonkey first.

For Google Chrome users, your browser has built-in support for userscripts,
all you need is drag into Chrome.
